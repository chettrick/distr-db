# distr-db
database engine implementing CQRS via separate reads and writes

## API
The API uses JSON throughout.
A movie JSON object has four fields:

Field | Purpose | Type | Required Field
---|---|---|---
id   | A unique identifier for movies. | Numeric | Auto-generated by Transaction Server
name | Name of movie.                  | String  | Required
desc | Description of movie.           | String  | Optional
date | Release date of movie.          | String  | Required

Currently, there are only three HTTP requests that will get a response.

* Retrieve list of all movies from the database:
  * GET request to endpoint http://localhost:5555/api/movies
  * Example cURL command:
    ```
    $ curl -i http://localhost:5555/api/movies
    ```
  * Example response from transaction server:
```
